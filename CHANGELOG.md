## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-17

Initial public release.

### Added
- Five slash commands: `/start`, `/build`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/wrap`
- Three Claude Code hooks:
  - `SessionStart` — mechanical vault loader, reads project + patterns + memory as `additionalContext`
  - `PreToolUse` — frozen-zone guard blocking writes to configured paths
  - `SessionEnd` — auto-commit and push for both vault and Claude-config repos
- Vault pattern:
  - `VAULT_PROTOCOL.md` top-level protocol
  - `01-projects/<slug>/` skeleton (CLAUDE.md, current-state.md, decisions.md, open-questions.md, spec.md, architecture.md, sessions/)
  - `03-patterns/` with anti-patterns, credential-handling, agent-usage
- Global `CLAUDE.md` template
- `settings.json` template wiring all three hooks
- `config.sample.json` schema with documented fields
- Install scripts (`install.sh` for macOS/Linux/WSL, `install.ps1` for Windows)
- Interactive setup prompt at `install/setup-prompt.md`
- Example project demonstrating the vault layout
- Full documentation set (13 chapters) under `docs/`
- Logo SVG, banner SVG, Mermaid diagram sources

### Design decisions in this release
- Hooks for enforcement, skills for suggestions (see `03-patterns/anti-patterns.md` rule 1)
- Decision log is append-only; no rotation or archiving
- Memory files are cwd-keyed and tracked in the Claude-config repo
- Two separate repos (vault + claude-config) rather than one merged repo — separates project knowledge from user-level tooling
